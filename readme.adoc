= Sample project
v1.0, 2019-07-03

This is a sample project for RegExp Viewer plugin testing.

Plugin relies upon https://git.io/fj6Ib[built-in RegExp plugin] for RegExp
parsing and validation.

Built-in plugin relies on `RegExpLanguageHost` https://git.io/fj6Ix[extension point]
for RegExp host languages. There's 2 RegExp language hosts I know of, `JavaRegExpHost`
(two of them actually, for Java and Kotlin) and `GroovyRegExpHost`.

Plugin automatically detects RegExp language hosts in your IDEA installation and allows to
switch between different hosts in `.regexp` file editor.

So if there's some unknown `RegExpLanguageHost` is implemented on your system,
you still should be fine.

This sample project consists of 4 source folders with RegExps

* link:/src/main/java/JavaRegExp.java[Java]
* link:/src/main/kotlin/KotlinRegExp.kt[Kotlin]
* link:/src/main/groovy/GroovyRegExp.groovy[Groovy]
* link:/src/main/regexp/[plain `.regexp` files]

Feel free to request new languages to be added.
